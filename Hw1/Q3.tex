For all subsections, whenever the 3 bits aren't all the same, the reduction OR will yield 1 and the reduction AND will yield 0. 
Only when all bits are the same, both functions will yield the same result (x when all bits are x).
Thus, the error probability is that of drawing a sample where not all bits are the same, or equivalently, one minus the probability all bits are the same:
\begin{equation*}
    err_D = err_{f_1, D}(f_2) = err_{f_2, D}(f_1) = 1 - D(x_1=x_2=x_3)
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{}
There's an equal chance for drawing any permutation of the 3 bits, hence:
\begin{equation*}
    err_D = 1 - 2*\frac{1}{8} = 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{}
Now, the probability of the event $D(x_1=x_2=x_3)$ is 1, so:
\begin{equation*}
    err_D = 0
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{}
We need to design D such that $D(x_1=x_2=x_3) = \frac{9}{10}$. One possible choice is the following:
\begin{equation*}
    D = 
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{9}{10}, & x = '111' \\
        0, & x = '000' \\
        \frac{1}{60}, & x \neq \{'111', '000'\}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
